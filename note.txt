Flexbox vs. Floats: The Navbar uses display: flex, which makes horizontal alignment effortless. The main content uses float, which requires a clearfix (or a clearing div) to prevent the parent container from collapsing.

Measurement Units: I used vh (viewport height) for the navbar to ensure it scales based on the screen height, and vw for horizontal padding.

Calc() Function: The container width is set to calc(100% - 40px), which ensures there is always a fixed 20px margin on both sides regardless of the screen size.
