# Positioning, Flexbox, and Sizing Assignment

This project demonstrates three core CSS layout techniques:
1.  **Flexbox:** Used for the navigation bar to distribute space between links and the button.
2.  **Floats:** Used to create a traditional 70/30 split layout for the main content and sidebar.
3.  **Dynamic Sizing:** Utilizes `calc()`, `vh`, and `vw` units for a responsive feel.

### How to Run
1. Save the HTML code as `index.html`.
2. Save the CSS code as `style.css` in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
